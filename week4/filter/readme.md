# helpers.c

This is the file that I actually had to program.
  The other files were written by the CS50 team and provided taking input and making output.
  At the time I didn't know how to do this.
  
In helpers.c I was given 4 functions to make:
* Grayscale filter
* Reflect filter
* Blur filter
* Edge detection filter

For each of these functions I was given a custom "image" data type.

This data type contained three arrays.
* image[y][x].rgbtRed
* image[y][x].rgbtGreen
* image[y][x].rgbtBlue
