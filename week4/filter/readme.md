# Filter

The idea of this problem set was to make filters for photos like you see on photo editing apps.

The filters that I had to implement were:
* Grayscale
* Mirror
* Blur
* Edge-detection

For fun I also turned the edge-detection filter into a colouring image generator.
I elaborate on this in the <a href="https://github.com/metazine/cs50/blob/master/week4/filter/original_filter/readme.md">original_filter readme.md</a>.

The orginal_filter directory is what I wrote for CS50.
The redone_filter directory is when I rewrote the filters using TypeScript for fun.
