# CS50

<a href="https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a> is Harvard University's introduction to Computer Science.

CS50 covers the basics of many topics, including C, JavaScript, Python, HTML, CSS and SQL.
The course is 10 "weeks" long (excluding week 0), and each week is supposed to take 10-20 hours to complete.

I took a year to complete the course, doing it in my spare time out of school.

For each project I've written a short "readme" to explain what each project is doing.

# Note

Some of the source code was provided by CS50 to do things that hadn't yet or aren't covered in the course.
I've put comments at the top of files that were provided entirely by CS50 stating this.

Some files also have comments which are there to point the participant in the correct direction.
These are usually labelled as "TODO", and are from the CS50 team.
