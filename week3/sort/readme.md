# Sort.txt

In week3 of CS50 the focus was sorts and sorting algorithms.

In this algorithm I was given 3 pre-compiled scripts.
  I also had a few text files with lots of unsorted numbers.
  
After running the test I would see how long each of them took to run.

With that I had to work out which sorting algorithm was which.

It was tested on random data and reverse order data. 10000 numbers each.

## Results

Bubble sort was slowest. 0.47s average.

Insertion sort was twice as fast as bubble sort. 0.28s average.

Merge sort was 5 times faster than insertion sort. 0.051s average.

### Notes

On larger datasets this difference would greatly increase.
