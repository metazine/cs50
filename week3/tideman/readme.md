# tideman.c

## Notes

This was the task I found the hardest out of all of CS50.
  This was due to the amount of rules that I needed to follow.
    Also the amount of concepts I needed to understand
    It included graph theory which was new to me at the time.
    
## What is the Tideman voting system

It is so complex and really not very interesting. 
  I think it would be a waste of time to document this code.
  It is quite a cool algorithm but anything I would want to say is in the code as comments.
  
Cite the [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs) if it really matters.
