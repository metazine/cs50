## Tideman

The Tideman voting system is a way of selecting a winner using preferential voting.

The system is quite complex, and not very interesting to explain, so I'm just going to link the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_pairs">wikipedia article</a> about it.

This was the task I found the hardest out of all of CS50.
  This was due to the amount of concepts and rules I needed to understand.
    It included graph theory which was new to me at the time.
