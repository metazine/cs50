# Movies

In this problem set I had to a similar thing to that of <a href="https://github.com/metazine/cs50/tree/master/week7/lab7">Lab 7</a>.

I was given specific requests for things from the database.
Things like what films has Tom Hanks starred in with Matt Damon that have an IMDB rating that is greater than 8.
I would then write a query to get the information.

It also involved using JOIN, which I didn't need to do for lab 7.

However I don't have the original SQL queries that I wrote to do the task.
