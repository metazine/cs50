            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Electrolysis is a technique that uses direct current in order to create a chemical reaction that otherwise wouldn't happen. 
                This is typically used to seperate materials in ores.
                    Bauxite for example is split into aluminium and water
            </p>
            <p>
            The word electrolysis is derived from 2 latin words.

            <h2>How does it work</h2>
            <p>
                In an ionic bond atoms become stable by either "losing" electrons from their outershells, or picking up the lost electrons to complete their outer shell.

            </p>
            <p>
                The basic premise of electrolysis is providing these electrons.
                    This is done using electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The electricity is supplied through two electrodes.
                    These are typically made out of graphite.
                    Through the graphite rod a direct current is passed.
                        This creates one positive and one negative electrode.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The compound being seperated is melted
                    This means that the ions can freely move.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positive ions are atoms that have lost electrons.
                    As electrons are negative, the negative electrode has more electrons.
                    The positive ions are attracted to the negative electrode.
                    A positive ion is called a cation.
                    A negative electrode is called a cathode.
            </p>

            <p>
                The same principle applies with negative ions and positive electrodes.
                    A negative ion is called an anion.
                    A positive electrode is called an anode.
