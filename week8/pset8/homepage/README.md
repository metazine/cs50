# Homepage

For week 8 we had to make 4 html pages that used JavaScript about whatever we wanted.

I did my pages about Chemistry, as a way to revise Chemistry and do CS50.

For the JS I used <a href="https://p5js.org/">p5.js</a>, which is a library for beginners to make animations.
For styling I used <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> which has a CSS library.
