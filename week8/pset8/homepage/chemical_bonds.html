    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        There are two types of intermolecular bonds: covalent and ionic bonds.
        A covalent bond is where atoms "share" electrons in order to fill their shells.
        In an ionic bond one atom loses electrons and the other gains electrons. 
        This also fills the shell and makes the atom stable.
    </p>
    <h2>Covalent bonds</h2>
    <p>
        In a covalent bond the atoms "share" electrons.
        This means that the electrons in both atoms can then move freely between the two.
        Covalent bonds are typically strong.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metals cannot form a covalent bond.
        This is because it is always easier for a metal to lose its electrons than gain multiple.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of a covalent bond is hydrochloric acid (HCl).
    </p>
    <p>
        Hydrogen needs 2 electrons in its outer shell to become stable.
        It already has 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine needs 8 electrons in its outer shell to become stable.
        It already has 7.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what happens is the hydrogen shares its one electron with chlorine.
        The chlorine  becomes stable.
        The chlorine atom shares one electron with the hydrogen atoms.
        The hydrogen becomes stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chlorine and the hydrogen now have a very strong bond - a covalent bond.
    </p>
    <h2>Ionic Bonds</h2>
    <p>
        Ionic bonds are another type of intermolecular bond.
        However an ionic bond only occurs between a metal and non metal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metals have 4 or fewer electrons.
        This means that it is easier for a metal to lose less than 4 electrons than gain 4+.
        This means that metals always lose their electrons in order to become stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        For the same reason it is easier for a non metal to just gain 3+ electrons than lose 5+ electrons.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because electrons have a negative charge gaining them leaves you with a negative charge.
        And losing them leaves you with a positive charge.
        This positively/negatively charged atom is called an ion.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metal ions are always positive.
        Non metal ions are always negative.
    </p>
    <p>
        This negative/positive has the effect of pulling together the two atoms.
        This is what fundamentally holds together a ionic bond.
        This also means that it is generally weaker than a covalent bond.
    </p>
    <p>An example of this is salt (NaCl)</p>

    <p>
        Sodium has 1 electron in its outershell.
        If it loses this one electron it is left with a full electron shell.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine has 7 electrons in its outershell.
        It needs 8 electrons total in order to become stable.
        If it gains one electron it becomes stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        So the sodium reacts with the chlorine and lose one electron.
        Because the electron is negative -(-1) is +1.
        This creates a positive sodium ion (+1).
    </p>
    <p>
        The chlorine on the other hand gains one electron from the sodium.
        Because the electron is negative +(-1) is -1.
        This creates a negative chlorine ion (-1)
    </p>
