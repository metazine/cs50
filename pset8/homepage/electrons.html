        <h1>What is an electron? (in short)</h1>
        <p>
            An electron is a sub-atomic particle that orbits around the nucleus.<br />
            Electrons have a negative charge (1-)
        </p>
        <h1>What is an electron? (in long)</h1>
        <h2>Positioning of electrons</h2>
        <p>
            Electrons orbit around the nucleus in certain rings which are called shells.
        </p>
        <p>
            At GCSE level the number of electrons in each shell is as follows:
            2, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8, 8.
        </p>
        <p>
            This means the first shell can contain a maximum of 2 electrons.
                The second to eighth row can also only contain 8.
        </p>
        <p>
            This isn't strictly true but it is a quick and easy rule that works for GCSE.

        <h2>Electrons and stability</h2>
        <p>
            In order for atoms to become 
            <span style="color:grey" title="Unreactive">stable</span>   
            they must have a full outer electron shell.
        </p>
        <p>This can be done in one of three ways: </p>
        <ul>
            <li class="bond-list">
                Already having a full outer shell (
