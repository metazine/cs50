    <h1>Types of chemical bonds</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        There are two types of intermolecular bonds: covalent and ionic bonds.
        A covalent bond is where atoms "share" electrons in order to fill their shells.
        In an ionic bond one atom loses electrons and the other gains electrons. 
        This also fills the shell and makes the atom stable.
    </p>
    <h2>Covalent bonds</h2>
    <p>
        In a covalent bond the atoms "share" electrons.
        This means that the electrons in both atoms can then move freely between the two.
        Covalent bonds are typically strong.
    </p>
    <p>
        Metals cannot form a covalent bond.
        This is because it is always easier for a metal to lose its electrons than gain multiple.
    </p>
    <p>
        An example of a covalent bond is hydrochloric acid (HCl).
    </p>
    <p>
        Hydrogen needs 2 electrons in its outer shell to become stable.
        It already has 1.
    </p>
    <p>
        Chlorine needs 8 electrons in its outer shell to become stable.
        It already has 7.
    </p>
    <p>
        So what happens is the hydrogen shares its one electron with chlorine.
        The chlorine  becomes stable.
        The chlorine atom shares one electron with the hydrogen atoms.
        The hydrogen becomes stable.
    </p>
    <p>
        The chlorine and the hydrogen now have a very strong bond - a covalent bond.
