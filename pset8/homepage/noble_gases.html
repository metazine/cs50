        <h1>Noble Gases</h1>
        <h2>What are the noble gases.</h2>
        <p>
            The noble gases are a group of elements that all have 8 electrons in their outershell.
            Apart from helium which has 2.
        </p>
        <p>
            What is the importance of this?
            Well this means that they are extremely unreactive.
            This is due to them already having their outershells filled.
            This means that they are stable as a single element.
        </p>
        <h2>Helium</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Helium is the first noble gas and has just 2 electrons.
                It is also incredibly light - lighter than air.
                This is why it is used in balloons and blimps.
                It is better than hydrogen for this as hydrogen is highly flammable.
                This can be very dangerous (i.e. Hindenburg Disaster)
            </p>

            <h2>Neon</h2>
            
            <p>
                Neon exudes a bright red colour when put in an electric field.
                This is why it is commonly used in neon signs.
                Neon is also used in some plasma displays for much the same reason.

            <h2>Argon</h2>
            <p>
                Argon is mainly used in welding due to its unreactive properties.
                It is so unreactive that even its name translates to "lazy".
                Welding uses incredibly hot temperatures and in normal circumstances could cause fire.
                I can't think of anything else interesting to say about because all the good facts Argon.
            </p>

        <h2>Krypton</h2>
        <p>
            Krypton is commonly used in florouescent lighting.
        </p>

        <h2>Xenon</h2>
        <p>
            Xenon was the first noble gas to be fabricated.
            It is used for lasers.
        </p>

        <h2>Radon</h2>
        <p>
            Radon is radioactive and is fairly common in dust in homes.
            Because it is radioactive it can cause lung cancer.
            Radon is believed to be the number two cause of lung cancer, behind smoking.
        </p>
        <h2>Oganesson</h2>
        <p>
            This is an incredibly rare element.
            Only 5 atoms of it have ever been detected.
            Unlike the rest of the noble gases it may be very reactive.
            But it was only in existance for a short time so we simply don't know for sure.
