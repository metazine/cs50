            <h1>Electrolysis</h1>
            <hr>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                Electrolysis is a technique that uses direct current in order to create a chemical reaction that otherwise wouldn't happen. 
                This is typically used to seperate materials in ores.
                    Bauxite for example is split into aluminium and water
            </p>
            <p>
                The word electrolysis is derived from 2 latin words.

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>
                In an ionic bond atoms become stable by either "losing" electrons from their outershells, or picking up the lost electrons to complete their outer shell.

            </p>
            <p>
                The basic premise of electrolysis is providing these electrons.
                    This is done using electricity.
            </p>
            <p>
                The electricity is supplied through two electrodes.
                    These are typically made out of graphite.
                    Through the graphite rod a direct current is passed.
                        This creates one positive and one negative electrode.
            </p>    
            <p>
                The compound being seperated is melted
                    This means that the ions can freely move.
            </p>
            <p>
                The positive ions are atoms that have lost electrons.
                    As electrons are negative, the negative electrode has more electrons.
                    The positive ions are attracted to the negative electrode.
                    They then gain electrons which makes the atom no longer be ions.
                        
                        A positive ion is called a cation.
                        A negative electrode is called a cathode.
            </p>

            <p>
                The same principle applies with negative ions and positive electrodes.
                    However instead of gaining electrons they lose them.
                    A negative ion is called an anion.
                    A positive electrode is called an anode.
            </p>
            <h3>Why is electrolysis used?</h3>

            <p>
                With most metals in their oxidised form they can be seperated with a displacement reaction.
                For example copper oxide + carbon â†’ carbon dioxide + copper.
            </p>
            <p>
                However for elements that are more reactive than carbon this doesn't work.
                    This is because the carbon cannot displace the more reactive elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Electrolysis is used in this situation.
