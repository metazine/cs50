        <h1>The Reactivity Series</h1>
        <p>
            The reactivity series is the order of how reactive different metals are.
            The least reactive metal is platinum.
                Platinum can only react at high temperatures with very strong acids.
            The most reactive metal is francium.
                Francium reacts explosively in water, and has a half life of just 22 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The reactivity is series is important in electrolysis.
                This is because more reactive elements can displace less reactive elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ores are generally an oxide.
                For example iron ore (hematite) is Fe&#8322;O&#8323;
